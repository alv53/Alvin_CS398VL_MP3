<p class="info">The first thing I did to create the visualization was to extract the important named entities in the book. I did this by combining two different approaches. The first approach was the chunking method we used to extract named entities in class. The second thing I did was use TF-IDF on the entire book to get important named entitiy (which in my past experience has quite frequently come up with mostly named entities). Neither approach by itself came up with a very good sample so I decided to get the set intersection of the two.</p>

<p class="info">Then I created the visualization of the edge bundling by sentence tokenizing the book, then looking for sentences were two named entities occured in the same sentence. This created a link between two named entities on the visualization.</p>

<p class="info">Finally I went deeper into each named entity's node on the visualization (which can be seen by clicking on a node). There you can see the important words connecting the original node, to all nodes connected to it. To get this, I used TF-IDF again, but this time to calculated the 5 most important named entitiy connecting the original named entity to the other named entity.</p>
